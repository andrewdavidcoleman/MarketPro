### MarketPro is an internal facing browser based app for tracking sales data of individual salespeople in companies with small sales teams.

* The user is brought to a sign in page where they are prompted to log in or create a new account.

* Once the user logs in they are presented with a dashboard displaying their cumulative sales totals for 3 different metrics, and a form to input new sales from the day.
* When they input their new sales, the totals are updated accordingly.
